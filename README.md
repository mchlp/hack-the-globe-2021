# Project Description
Chip In is a one of a kind corporate giving platform that enables employees to donate to local charities and build their unique charity portfolio. We developed the platform around three key pillars:
 
1. The platform give employees a voice in their company’s donations. It encourages employees to become more involved in their company’s CSR initiatives and shifts power away from upper level management.

2. The platform adopts a hyper-local approach and maximizes the community impact of the user’s contributions by spotlighting grassroots NGOs, as opposed to large, well-established charities.

3. The platform aggregates data related to employee interests and past donation history to identify key passion points, thereby informing management on how to best empower their workforce.

# How We Built It

Over the course of two weeks, our team ideated and refined our idea after engaging in conversations with consultants from BCG, industry experts, and non-profit leaders. We identified key pain points in existing corporate giving systems and designed hi-fidelity mockups on Figma. We built the web app with React/Express and wrote a script to scrape and parse the list of local charities. Our recommendation algorithm scores each charity based on its alignment to the user's interests and past donation history. The platform is focused on charities related to equitable societies, which we divided up into the following sub-categories: Crisis Response, Accessibility, Systemic Racism, LGBTQ+, and Gender Equality. All the charities we recommend to users will be from one of these five categories with a strong focus on hyperlocal charities.

# Key Challenges
Working remotely was a challenge for our team, as we had to coordinate tasks despite not being in the same physical space. We also ran into technical obstacles regarding Git merge conflicts, developing the recommendation alogrithm, and building out a database of charities. Not to mention, some of us had no prior experience with web development. In addition, the hackathon was only 36 hours long, thus we worked under immense time pressures to produce a working prototype and accompanying go-to market strategy.

# Future Considerations
In the future, we hope to scale the platform to include charities all across the country and beyond the scope of our initial 5 sub-categories. We'd also like to build out the capability to store specific professional skillsets of each user, such that they can choose to either donate money or donate their time on a pro-bono basis.
